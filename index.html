            <p>If you ever need a helping hand,you will find one at the end of your arm... As you grow older you will
                discover
                that you have two hands. One for helping yourself, the other for helping others. So,we all should help
                others.</p>

            <p>The Prophet ﷺ said, “Seven (people) will be shaded by Allah by His Shade on the Day of Resurrection when
                there will be no shade except His Shade. A man, who gives in charity so
                secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given.” [Sahih al-Bukhari]
